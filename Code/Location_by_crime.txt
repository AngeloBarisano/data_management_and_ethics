-- Create a VIEW with the time components split up

-- Question 1: Location By time:


-- 1) Total Crime count in general by district

--i) Total Crimes by District over total time
SELECT District, COUNT(*)
FROM CriminalCase AS CC INNER JOIN Location L ON L.Beat = CC.Beat
GROUP BY District ;


--ii) Total Primary Crimes by District over total time
SELECT District, PrimaryCategory, COUNT(*) AS TotalCrimesRecorded
FROM CriminalCase AS CC INNER JOIN CrimeType as CT ON CC.IUCR = CT.IUCR INNER JOIN Location AS L ON L.Beat = CC.Beat
GROUP BY District, PrimaryCategory;

-- try the same with a window function
SELECT PrimaryCategory, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY COUNT(*))
FROM CriminalCase AS CC INNER JOIN CrimeType as CT ON CC.IUCR = CT.IUCR INNER JOIN Location AS L ON L.Beat = CC.Beat
GROUP BY PrimaryCategory;


--iii) Now filter for high arrest crimes 
SELECT PrimaryCategory, ProportionArrested
FROM view_resource_crimes
WHERE ProportionArrested > 50;

SELECT *
FROM view_resource_crimes;



-- iiii) rank district by average crime count aggregated
-- RANK DISTRICT by the proportion of overall proportion by crime type committed of that category
-- to do that add the overall total numbers of crimes committed via a left join of total crimes committed
